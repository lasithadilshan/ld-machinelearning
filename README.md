## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lasithadilshan/ld-machinelearning.git
   cd ld-machinelearning
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can use it to:

- Explore different machine learning models.
- Visualize data and model predictions.
- Adjust model parameters and see the effects in real-time.
